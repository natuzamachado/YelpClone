This webpage is a pixel perfect clone project, which was proposed by App Academy Open bootcamp. 
In this project I was challenged to replicate the design of the Yelp home page using my HTML and CSS knowledge.
This project was not guided, meaning that all the code and thinking process to execute this project was mine.
